# Autoclicker

## About

An autoclicker coded in Python, which automatically clicks on the screen after the letter "a" is inputted, and stops clicking on the screen after the letter "b" is inputted.

NOTE: You will need the `pynput` module to control the mouse and monitor the keyboard at the same time in order to create an autoclicker. You can install this by simply typing `pip install pynput` in cmd. Then, verify the installation by executing `import pynput`. If the output gives zero errors, the module is successfully installed.

## Execution

Run `python3 Autoclicker.py` in a terminal if you have Python 3.
